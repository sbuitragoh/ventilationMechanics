Amidst the COVID-19 emergency, the use of ventilators for assisted mechanical ventilation became more necessary and required given the rising number of cases. 

# Ventilation Modes and Reference Generators

The ventilators have a set number of modes which may be used in the patient. These modes are determined with a set of parameters that are given by the doctors. Using these parameters, we can generate the reference for the control of the electro-pneumatic circuit.
